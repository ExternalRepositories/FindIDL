# Introduction
IDL is used for creating COM servers. Unfortunately CMake has a limited support for IDL, so this module comes to rescue. The Type Library Importer converts the type definitions found within a COM type library into equivalent definitions in a common language runtime assembly. The output of Tlbimp.exe is a binary file (an assembly) that contains runtime metadata for the types defined within the original type library.

## Requirements
- [CMake 3.0](https://cmake.org/download/) or higher
- MIDL compiler
- Tlbimp.exe

# Usage
## find_package()
Add [FindIDL](https://github.com/apriorit/FindIDL) to the module search path and call `find_package`:
```cmake
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../cmake")
find_package(IDL REQUIRED)
```
[FindIDL](https://github.com/apriorit/FindIDL) will search for midl.exe
Also if you are going to use tlbimp, you should call `find_package` for tlbimp:
```cmake
find_package(TLBIMP REQUIRED)
```
[FindIDL](https://github.com/apriorit/FindIDL) will search for Tlbimp.exe

## add_idl() (simple mode)
Takes two arguments: the name of the target project and idl file, possible with full path specified.
```cmake
add_idl(<name> source)
```
Where:
- `<name>` - name of the target project
- `source` - full path to idl file

Example:
```cmake
add_idl(GreeterIDL Greeter.idl)
```

The function makes the same work as MIDL, specifically generates files:
- Greeter_i.h
- Greeter_i.c
- Greeter_p.c
- Greeter.tlb

To use the generated files the idl project should be linked as following
```cmake
target_link_libraries(Main GreeterIDL)
```

## add_idl() (with tlbimp mode)
Takes four arguments: the name of the target project, idl file, possible with full path specified, TLBIMP flag and the name of the tlbimp target. 
```cmake
add_idl(<name> source TLBIMP <tlbimp name>)
```
Where:
- `<name>` - name of the target project
- `source` - full path to idl file
- `TLBIMP` - flag to indicate with tlbimp mode
- `<tlbimp name>` - name of the tlbimp target

Example:
```cmake
add_idl(GreeterIDLWithTLBIMP Greeter.idl TLBIMP GreeterDLLWithTLBIM)
```

The function makes the same work as MIDL with Tlbimp.exe, specifically generates files:
- Greeter_i.h
- Greeter_i.c
- Greeter_p.c
- Greeter.tlb
- GreeterDLLWithTLBIMP.dll (in CMAKE_BINARY_DIR)

To use the generated files the idl project should be linked as following
```cmake
target_link_libraries(Main GreeterIDL)
```
Or if you want to use file generated by tlbimp:
```cmake
set_property(TARGET MainWithTLBIMP PROPERTY VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES
    GreeterDLLWithTLBIMP
    "System") 
```

## MIDL flags
It is possible to specify MIDL flags, such as midl command line keys.
```cmake
set(MIDL_FLAGS /target NT60)
```
Current can be useful to avoid MIDL2455 error.
